I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) in the CMS department. I'm excited to be a part of the [Computational Camera Lab](https://computationalcameras.org/) under the guidance of [Katie Bouman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/), and co-advised by [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php) and [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/). My research focuses on controlled generation and solving scientific inverse problems with diffusion models.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I had the privilege of working with [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/) and [Yang Gao](https://yang-gao.weebly.com/). During a visit to [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), I worked with [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~junyanz/), [Eli Shechtman](https://research.adobe.com/person/eli-shechtman/), and [Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io/).
